# Contributing to Customer-segmentation-project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Customer-segmentation-project**!  
This open-source repository focuses on analysing and segmenting customer data (using clustering, RFM, etc.) to drive insights and business value. Every contribution — whether small or large — is warmly welcomed.

## 🚀 How You Can Contribute

- **Data & Feature Enhancements**: Add new customer datasets, refine cleaning, improve feature engineering (e.g., demographics, RFM metrics, behavioural features).  
- **Segmentation & Model Improvements**: Experiment with clustering algorithms (K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN), perform advanced analysis, compare results, tune parameters and optimise segments.  
- **Visualization & Dashboards**: Create clear and compelling visualisations or interactive dashboards (e.g., Power BI, Tableau, Plotly) that illustrate segment profiles, business implications and strategies.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, add step-by-step guides, code comments, notebooks for beginners, explain segmentation logic and business use-cases.  
- **Bug Fixes & Code Optimisation**: Fix issues, clean up notebooks/scripts, ensure reproducibility and improve the architecture or pipeline.
